Note that the wiki page "electricity peak current month" is no longer valid. The YAML of this project uses direct readouts of the Belgian capacity tariff from the DSMR component to show 3 values:
     
    active_energy_import_current_average_demand:
      name: "Peak Current Average Quarterly Demand"
      icon: mdi:chart-sankey
    active_energy_import_maximum_demand_running_month:
      name: "Peak Month Maximum Quarterly Demand"
      icon: mdi:chart-sankey
    active_energy_import_maximum_demand_last_13_months:
      name: "Peak 13 Month Maximum Quarterly Demand"
      icon: mdi:chart-sankey

All other pages remain valid.
